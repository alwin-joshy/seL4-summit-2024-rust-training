# Using a Serial Device

In this chapter, we will build a root task that interacts with a serial device.
Start by navigating to and running this chapter's example, which, so far, doesn't do anything interesting.

```
cd workspaces/root-task/serial-device
make simulate
```

The module at {{#gh_link @-5 (workspaces/root-task/serial-device/src/)device.rs}} implements a higher-level interface over the serial device's MMIO registers, whose physical base address is:

{{#fragment_with_gh_link "rust,ignore" @-5 workspaces/root-task/serial-device/src/main.rs:16:16}}

Our first goal will be to map the serial device's MMIO registers into the root task's address space.

After that, we will set up the root task's access to the serial device's IRQ, whose value is:

{{#fragment_with_gh_link "rust,ignore" @-5 workspaces/root-task/serial-device/src/main.rs:18:18}}

Finally, we will implement a simple loop that echos serial input to serial output.

{{#step 5.A}}

First, add some familiar snippets that we will use for allocating CSlots and kernel objects:

{{#fragment_with_gh_link "rust,ignore" @5.A workspaces/root-task/serial-device/src/main.rs:34:44}}

{{#fragment_with_gh_link "rust,ignore" @5.A workspaces/root-task/serial-device/src/main.rs:22:27}}

{{#step 5.B (exercise)}}

`largest_kernel_ut` will be useful for allocating kernel objects whose backing physical addresses don't matter to us, but we must allocate the frame which contains the serial device's MMIO registers at a particular physicall address (`SERIAL_DEVICE_MMIO_PADDR`).
Furthermore, the seL4 API distinguishes between _general purpose untyped_ _device untyped_. General purpose untyped is backed by normal memory, and can be used to create any type of object. Device untyped is not backed by normal memory, and can only be used to create frames.
See the last two paragraphs of {{#manual_link #2.4 (Kernel Memory Allocation)}} for more information.
So, we must allocate the serial device MMIO frame from the particular initial device untyped that contains `SERIAL_DEVICE_MMIO_PADDR`.

**Exercice:** Identify this initial untyped in the `bootinfo`. We will need a corresponding `sel4::cap::Untyped` along with the untyped's physical address (or `sel4::UntypedDesc`, which contains the physical address) for the next step.

{{#step 5.C}}

The untyped we've identified contains the frame we are targeting, but that frame may be somewhere in the middle of the region of device memory the untyped covers.
To allocate the frame at `SERIAL_DEVICE_MMIO_PADDR`, we must allocate dummy objects from this untyped until its watermark is at `SERIAL_DEVICE_MMIO_PADDR`.

This `trim_untyped` function takes the untyped capability, its physical address, the desired physical address, and two empty slots for temporarily holding dummy objects.
We need two slots because the kernel resets an untyped's watermark if it has no live children.
So, we must always keep one child around so that our progress on advancing the watermark is never lost.

{{#fragment_with_gh_link "rust,ignore" @5.C workspaces/root-task/serial-device/src/main.rs:43:49}}

{{#fragment_with_gh_link "rust,ignore" @5.C workspaces/root-task/serial-device/src/main.rs:68:95}}

{{#step 5.D}}

`device_ut_cap` is now primed; the physical address of the next allocation will be `SERIAL_DEVICE_MMIO_PADDR`.

**Exercise:** Allocate a small frame object (`sel4::cap_type::Granule`) from `device_ut_cap`.

If your `sel4::cap::Granule` is called `serial_device_frame_cap`, then the following assertion should succeed:

{{#fragment_with_gh_link "rust,ignore" @5.D workspaces/root-task/serial-device/src/main.rs:68:71}}

{{#step 5.E (exercise)}}

**Exercise:** Using code from [Step 4.B](./address-space.html#step-4b), [Step 4.C](./address-space.html#step-4c), and [Step 4.D](./address-space.html#step-4d-exercise), map `serial_device_frame_cap` into the root task's virtual address space.

You should now be able interact with the serial device's MMIO registers.
Try printing "Hello, World!" to the serial console with something like:

{{#fragment_with_gh_link "rust,ignore" @5.E workspaces/root-task/serial-device/src/main.rs:100:106}}

where `serial_device_mmio_page_addr: *mut _` is a pointer to where the MMIO registers are mapped in the root task's virtual address space.
