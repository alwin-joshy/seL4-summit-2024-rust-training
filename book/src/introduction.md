# Introduction

Support for Rust in seL4 userspace has been an official seL4 Foundation project since November 2023:

<https://github.com/seL4/rust-sel4>

The exports of this project covered in this training are:
- Rust bindings for the seL4 API
- A runtime for root tasks
- Rust bindings for the seL4 Microkit API
- A runtime for [seL4 Microkit](https://github.com/seL4/microkit) protection domains
- Custom rustc [target specifications](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/embedonomicon/custom-target.html) for seL4 userspace

This training session is a hands-on tutorial that will lead you through the usage of those exports.
- [Part I](#the-root-task) covers the Rust bindings for the seL4 API and the runtime for root tasks
- [Part II](#sel4-microkit) covers the Rust bindings for the seL4 Microkit API and the runtime for microkit protection domains
